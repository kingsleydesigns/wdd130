            <p> Hello everyone!The name is Kingsley and I appreciate the opportunity to introduce myself as well as learn a bit about y'all. 
                I am Nigerian and currently in my last year of University. I am a Calisthenics athlete and I've been doing that for about 4 years now. Some of my other hobbies include reading novels[mystery and thrillers are my favorite] and playing video games.
                I also plan to do a lot of travelling and learning multiple languages to go with it. I am learning French at the moment and hope to practice with anyone who speaks it fluently. I'm really loving my degree path which is Software Development and enjoying coding so much. I can't wait to become really proficient with it and start putting my knowledge to use in the outside world.
                Although it would take a lot of effort and time, I am willing to do my best in this degree program in regards to assignments, team projects and studying the course material.
                I know that together with prayers and faith in heavenly father, I can succeed despite any difficulties i face.
                I look forward to reading all about you guys and making new friends as well.</p>
