        <p> Hello everyone!The name is Kingsley and I appreciate the opportunity to introduce myself as well as learn a bit about y'all. 
            I am Nigerian and currently in my last year of University. I am a Calisthenics athlete and I've been doing that for about 4 years now. Some of my other hobbies include reading novels[mystery and thrillers are my favorite] and playing video games.
            I also plan to do a lot of travelling and learning multiple languages to go with it. I am learning French at the moment and hope to practice with anyone who speaks it fluently. I'm really loving my degree path which is Software Development and enjoying coding so much. I can't wait to become really proficient with it and start putting my knowledge to use in the outside world.
            I look forward to reading all about you guys and making new friends as well.</p>
